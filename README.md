Introduction
The Random Forest Classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we apply the Random Forest algorithm to the well-known Iris dataset. The dataset consists of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) of iris flowers, with the target variable being the class of iris.
